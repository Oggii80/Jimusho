This is a proof of concept for the Jimusho Dojo management program.  In this first iteration, the user is able to add and remove students and assign belt ranks.
The information entered in text boxes is passed along to a DLL that will create a record for the student, which is then added to a list.  While the main UI shows 
the user the records they've created, all of the work is done in the background by DojoCore.

Future iterations will allow managers to track things like billing, scheduling, and other tasks that help with managing their facility.
The term Jimusho comes from a Japanese word meaning something along the lines of "Administrative Office," or an office specifically used for clerical work.
